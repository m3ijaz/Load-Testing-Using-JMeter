# Load-Testing-Using-JMeter
First, you need to download JMeter Software. For this go to: https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi then download the latest version from the Binaries section.
After downloading, complete your load testing for any website by using JMeter. For my testing, I use ( https://evaly.com.bd ) website. 
If you want to see my testing report, please download the index.html file and run it in your own browser.
